# TL; DR
1. This project was done for assignment 4 of COS221
2. This project is hosted and done in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> with the <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> build tool
3. This project has a compiled and custom runtime image(exe) here: 
4. You can edit and play around with this project(if you want to) and even distribute as long as you link back to this repo as original source
5. Although this app makes use of JAVAFX, I never used native functionality to design the app but rather embeded a web app into the webview. I made this decision because of time constraints.
