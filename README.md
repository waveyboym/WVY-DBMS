5. Although this app makes use of JAVAFX, I never used native functionality to design the app but rather embeded a web app into the webview. I made this decision because of time constraints.
6. The UI was fully designed in <a href="https://www.figma.com/">figma</a>. <a href="#">Click here to access the design file</a>(Note you need to have <a href="https://www.figma.com/downloads/">figma</a> installed in order to open fig files)
